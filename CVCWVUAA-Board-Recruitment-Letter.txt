Dear CVCWVUAA Alumni,

URGENT: Our Chapter Needs YOU Now More Than Ever!

I'm writing to you today with both concern and hope about the future of our Central Virginia Chapter of West Virginia University Alumni Association. We are at a critical moment that will determine whether our chapter continues to thrive or faces an uncertain future.

THE URGENT SITUATION:
Our past president recently reached out to our membership asking for volunteers to serve on the board because our current board members are stepping down. The response has been deeply disappointing and frankly alarming. Out of our entire membership, only ONE person—myself—stepped up to volunteer for board service.

This means we now have an ENTIRE BOARD to fill, with only the president position secured. Without immediate action from our alumni community, we risk losing the chapter that has been a cornerstone of Mountaineer pride in Central Virginia for years.

WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW:
We need to fill EVERY board position except president. This includes roles for:

• Vice President
• Secretary  
• Treasurer
• Event Coordinators
• Membership Chair
• Communications Director
• Fundraising Committee Chairs

Beyond board positions, we desperately need volunteers to help with:
• Watch parties for WVU games
• Fundraising events and initiatives
• Chapter picnics and social gatherings
• Get-togethers and networking events
• Scholarship program coordination
• Social media and communications

WE CAN MAKE THIS CHAPTER GREAT AGAIN:
With your help, we can make this chapter as big and productive as it once was. We have the potential, we have the alumni base, and we have the Mountaineer spirit—what we need is YOUR commitment to step up and get involved.

THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE YOU:
This isn't just a plea for help—it's an invitation to make a meaningful difference. Board service offers you the chance to:

• Give back to the university and community that helped shape who you are today
• Network with accomplished professionals and lifelong friends
• Develop leadership skills and gain valuable nonprofit experience
• Directly impact the lives of current WVU students through our scholarship programs
• Be part of preserving and strengthening Mountaineer traditions in Central Virginia
• Create lasting memories while serving alongside passionate fellow alumni

WHAT'S REQUIRED:
We're not asking for an overwhelming time commitment. Most board positions require:
• Attendance at monthly board meetings (typically 1-2 hours)
• Participation in 3-4 major events per year
• Occasional committee work or special projects
• A willingness to collaborate and contribute ideas

We have opportunities for various skill sets and interest levels—from event planning and marketing to financial oversight and membership engagement.

THIS IS OUR MOMENT OF TRUTH:
The fact that only one person responded to our past president's call for help is deeply concerning. It tells me that either our alumni don't understand how critical this situation is, or they're waiting for someone else to step up. 

I'M ASKING YOU DIRECTLY: Will you be the person who helps save our chapter?

We're not asking for your life—we're asking for your help. The time commitment is manageable, but the impact is immeasurable. Think about what this chapter has meant to you over the years. Think about the connections you've made, the events you've enjoyed, and the pride you've felt in being part of the Mountaineer family in Central Virginia.

THE NEXT STEPS:
If you feel even a small tug at your heart after reading this letter, we encourage you to:

1. Reach out to any current board member to learn more about specific opportunities
2. Attend our next board meeting as an observer to see what's involved
3. Consider volunteering for a specific event or committee before committing to a board position
4. Talk to other alumni who might be interested in getting involved

We're also looking for non-board volunteers who can help with specific projects, events, or initiatives. Every contribution matters, whether it's helping with registration at events, contributing expertise for special projects, or simply spreading the word about our activities.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
We have a choice to make as a chapter. We can either come together right now and rebuild this organization to be as strong and vibrant as it once was, or we can watch it disappear due to lack of participation.

I refuse to let that happen, but I can't do it alone.

PLEASE—STEP UP NOW:
• Volunteer for a board position
• Commit to helping with specific events
• Offer to coordinate watch parties  
• Help with fundraising efforts
• Assist with planning picnics and get-togethers
• Share your professional skills with the chapter
• Simply show up and get involved

We have everything we need to make this chapter successful again—everything except enough people willing to roll up their sleeves and do the work.

The past president asked for help and got almost no response. I'm asking again, but this time I'm being completely honest about where we stand. We're at a crossroads, and your decision to get involved or remain on the sidelines will determine our future.

Don't wait. Don't assume someone else will do it. Don't let our chapter fail because nobody was willing to step up when it mattered most.

CONTACT ME TODAY if you're ready to be part of the solution. Together, we can make the Central Virginia Chapter as big, productive, and proud as it once was.

The choice is yours. The time is now.

Will YOU help save our chapter?

Mountaineer Pride Lives Here,

The CVCWVUAA Board of Directors

P.S. If every person who reads this letter recruits just one other person to get involved, we'll solve our volunteer shortage overnight. Please don't just read this—act on it, and encourage others to do the same.
