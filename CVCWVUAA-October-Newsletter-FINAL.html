    <div class="section-header">CHAPTER UPDATE</div>
    <p>Dear Fellow Mountaineers,</p>
    
    <p>This newsletter provides a comprehensive October update about the chapter's status, upcoming activities, and opportunities for member involvement. Most importantly, please complete the member survey - your input is essential!</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Transition:</strong> In December 2024, then-President Jennifer Condaras announced that the entire board would be stepping down in June 2025 to allow fresh leadership. After no other members volunteered, Timothy Casten stepped forward as President and was officially announced in August 2025.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Current Leadership:</strong> Several former board members have graciously attended transition meetings to help with the transition. Their help has been appreciated.</p>

    <div class="section-header">MEMBER SURVEY - ACTION REQUIRED</div>
    <p class="highlight">A survey has been sent to all members. Please take 10 minutes to fill it out - the chapter needs your input on priorities, activities, and preferences for moving forward.</p>

    <div class="mission-header">OUR SCHOLARSHIP MISSION</div>
    <p>It's important to remember that while watch parties, get-togethers, and social events are wonderful for staying connected as Mountaineers, <strong>the real reason the chapter exists is to provide educational support for area youth through the Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship.</strong> The primary mission is to collect funds for the WVU Foundation and, in particular, to keep funding the chapter's scholarship that helps deserving students achieve their educational dreams.</p>

    <p><strong>WVU Foundation Partnership:</strong> Meeting Monday, October 6th in Morgantown with Kevin Berry and David Alloway from the Foundation and Alumni Association to explore chapter revitalization strategies and present our major scholarship contribution.</p>
