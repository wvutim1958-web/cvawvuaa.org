## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Social Media Links Are Placeholder/Broken**
**Problem:** The social-media.js file has placeholder URLs that don't work:
```javascript
facebook: 'https://facebook.com/CVCWVUAA',  // Not real
twitter: 'https://twitter.com/CVCWVUAA',     // Not real
instagram: 'https://instagram.com/CVCWVUAA', // Not real
```

**Impact:** Users clicking social media links get 404 errors  
**Fix:** Update `/js/social-media.js` with your actual social media account URLs

---

### 2. **Emoji Icons Still Present (Encoding Risk)**
**Problem:** The social-media.js still uses emoji icons (üìò, üê¶, üì∑, etc.) which can cause encoding issues

**Impact:** May display as empty boxes or corrupted characters on some browsers  
**Fix:** Remove emojis from social-media.js, use text-only or CSS icons instead

---

### 3. **Member Portal is "Coming Soon"**
**Problem:** The member portal link appears in navigation but only shows a placeholder page

**Impact:** Confusing user experience - looks like a broken feature  
**Options:**
- Remove the member portal link from nav until it's ready
- Build a simple password-protected member area
- Implement MemberSpace or similar service

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY (Fix Soon)

### 4. **Inconsistent Navigation Across Pages**
**Problem:** Some pages have different nav menus:
- `index.html` & `events.html`: Have "üîê Members" link
- `membership.html`: Missing "News" dropdown
- `pay.html`, `scholarship.html`: Have News dropdown but different structure

**Impact:** Confusing navigation experience  
**Fix:** Standardize all page navigation to match index.html

---

### 5. **Missing Mobile Nav on Some Pages**
**Problem:** Not all pages load the dropdown.js script consistently

**Impact:** Dropdown menus may not work properly on mobile  
**Fix:** Ensure all pages include `<script src="/js/dropdown.js"></script>`

---

### 6. **CSS Warning: Missing 'appearance' Property**
**Problem:** styles.css line 768 uses `-webkit-appearance` without standard `appearance`

**Impact:** May not work properly in non-webkit browsers  
**Fix:** Add `appearance: none;` alongside `-webkit-appearance: none;`

---

### 7. **Broken Backup Folder Clutter**
**Problem:** Multiple backup/deployment folders in workspace:
- netlify-complete-deploy-20251003-110113/
- netlify-deploy-20251003-011149/
- netlify-final-deploy-20251003-015335/
- CVCWVUAA-FINAL-DEPLOY-111159/

**Impact:** Confusing workspace, accidentally editing wrong files  
**Fix:** Delete old backup folders or move to separate archive location

---

## üìã MEDIUM PRIORITY (Improve User Experience)

### 8. **Event Management System Issues**
**Problem:** You tried to use an admin page to add events but it didn't work (static site limitation)

**Current Workaround:** Manually editing events/events.json  
**Better Solution:** Consider:
- Using a headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity)
- Netlify CMS for admin interface
- Google Sheets + API integration

---

### 9. **No Meta Tags for Social Sharing**
**Problem:** When sharing site links on Facebook/Twitter, no custom preview appears

**Impact:** Less professional when shared, lower engagement  
**Fix:** Add Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags (social-media.js attempts this but may not be working properly)

---

### 10. **Duplicate JavaScript Files**
**Files Found:**
- cbs-data-fetcher.js
- cbs-data-fetcher-test.js
- cbs-data-fetcher-clean.js
- cbs-data-fetcher.js.bak

**Impact:** Confusion about which file is actually used  
**Fix:** Delete unused versions, keep only the production file

---

### 11. **Missing Analytics Implementation Check**
**Problem:** Google Analytics is included, but not verified it's working properly

**Impact:** May not be tracking visitors correctly  
**Fix:** Verify GA is firing correctly using Google Tag Assistant

---

## üí° NICE TO HAVE (Future Improvements)

### 12. **Improve Member Portal Value Proposition**
**Current:** "Coming Soon" placeholder  
**Suggested Features:**
- Password-protected member directory
- Meeting minutes downloads
- Member-only event registration
- Photo galleries from events
- Membership card downloads

---

### 13. **Add Search Functionality**
**Current:** search.html exists but functionality unclear  
**Suggestion:** Implement simple client-side search or use Algolia/Lunr.js

---

### 14. **Create Alumni Spotlight Content Pipeline**
**Current:** alumni-spotlight.html exists but content management unclear  
**Suggestion:** Create simple process for submitting/approving spotlight stories

---

### 15. **Optimize Images**
**Problem:** Many photos in `/assets/photos/` may not be optimized

**Impact:** Slow page load times, especially on mobile  
**Fix:** Run images through compression (TinyPNG, ImageOptim)

---

### 16. **Add Loading States**
**Problem:** Dynamic content (events, scores) loads without loading indicators

**Impact:** Users may think content is broken  
**Fix:** Add "Loading..." spinners to dynamic sections

---

### 17. **Implement Service Worker Properly**
**File exists:** sw.js  
**Problem:** Not clear if it's registered/working  
**Benefit:** Offline support, faster repeat visits  
**Fix:** Verify service worker is properly implemented

---

### 18. **Create 404 Page Content**
**Current:** 404.html exists but content may be basic  
**Suggestion:** Add helpful links, search, humor, navigation back to main site

---

### 19. **Scholarship Application Process**
**Current:** scholarship.html exists but application process unclear  
**Suggestion:** 
- Clear deadlines
- Online application form (via Formspree or Netlify Forms)
- Automatic email confirmations

---

### 20. **Email List Integration**
**Current:** Mailchimp references exist  
**Check:** 
- Is signup form working?
- Are new members being added automatically?
- Email templates created?
