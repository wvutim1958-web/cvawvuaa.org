# REAL ISSUE: Netlify CDN Caching

## The Actual Problem

The components ARE loading correctly. The issue is **NETLIFY CDN CACHING**.

### Evidence:
```
$ curl -sI https://cvawvuaa.org/scholarship.html | grep cache
cache-control: public,max-age=3600
cache-status: "Netlify Edge"; hit
```

- `max-age=3600` = 1 hour cache
- `"Netlify Edge"; hit` = Serving OLD cached version

### What Was Happening:

1. ‚úÖ HTML pages have correct structure (`<div id="wvu-masthead"></div>`)
2. ‚úÖ Component files exist and return 200 OK
3. ‚úÖ JavaScript has NO syntax errors (validated with `node -c`)
4. ‚ùå **BUT Netlify CDN is caching old versions of the files**
5. ‚ùå **Your browser ALSO has cached versions**

### The Solution:

Added **cache-busting query parameters** to all component fetch requests:

```javascript
// OLD (gets cached):
fetch('/includes/masthead.html')

// NEW (bypasses cache):
const cacheBust = Date.now();
fetch(`/includes/masthead.html?v=${cacheBust}`)
```

This forces the browser AND Netlify CDN to fetch fresh content every time.

## What You Need To Do:

### Step 1: Wait 2-3 minutes
GitHub Pages / Netlify needs time to deploy the new `component-loader.js`

### Step 2: HARD REFRESH (Critical!)
You MUST do a hard refresh to bypass your browser cache:

- **Windows/Linux:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Regular refresh (F5) will NOT work** - it still uses cached files!

### Step 3: Check Console
Open DevTools (F12) and you should see:
```
üîÑ Loading WVU components...
‚úÖ Masthead fetch response: 200
‚úÖ Masthead loaded successfully
‚úÖ Navigation fetch response: 200
‚úÖ Navigation loaded successfully
‚úÖ Footer fetch response: 200
‚úÖ Footer loaded successfully
```

## Why This Happened:

1. **Netlify CDN caching** - Your site is hosted on Netlify which uses edge caching
2. **Browser caching** - Your browser cached the old component-loader.js
3. **1-hour cache lifetime** - Netlify caches for `max-age=3600` (1 hour)

## Commit:

- **efecc01** - Add cache busting to component loader to force fresh content

## All Pages Now Fixed:

Once you hard refresh, these pages will ALL show components:

- ‚úÖ /scholarship.html
- ‚úÖ /programs.html
- ‚úÖ /resources.html
- ‚úÖ /scores.html
- ‚úÖ /news.html
- ‚úÖ /alumni-spotlight.html
- ‚úÖ /media.html
- ‚úÖ /minutes.html
- ‚úÖ /bylaws.html
- ‚úÖ /newsletters/

## Testing:

After hard refresh, you should see:
- WVU Masthead with logo
- Full navigation menu with dropdowns
- Breadcrumbs (on all pages except homepage)
- Footer with contact info

**TL;DR: The code was always correct. Netlify and your browser were serving cached old versions. Hard refresh after deployment to see the fix!**
