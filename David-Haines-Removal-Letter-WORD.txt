OFFICIAL NOTICE: IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF DAVID HAINES FROM ALL BANKING ACCESS

*** EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT ***

Dear Bank Manager,

This letter serves as OFFICIAL NOTICE that David Haines is hereby IMMEDIATELY REMOVED from all banking privileges, signatory authority, and account access for the Central Virginia Chapter West Virginia University Alumni Association (CVCWVUAA) banking accounts.

AUTHORITY FOR REMOVAL

As the duly elected President and sole remaining Board Member of CVCWVUAA, I have the legal authority to revoke Mr. Haines' banking privileges. This action is taken due to:

• Incapacity: Mr. Haines suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2022 resulting in diminished cognitive capacity
• Resignation: He has resigned from his Treasurer position and all board duties
• Fiduciary Concerns: Discovery of financial management issues requiring immediate protective action

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, Towne Bank must:

1. REMOVE David Haines as signatory on all CVCWVUAA accounts
2. CANCEL all debit cards issued to David Haines (Village Bank and Towne Bank)
3. REVOKE all online banking access for David Haines
4. BLOCK any future transactions attempted by David Haines
5. ESTABLISH Timothy Casten as sole authorized signatory
6. CONFIRM in writing that all requested actions have been completed

LEGAL BASIS: This action is taken under Virginia Code §13.1-871 (corporate officer authority), common law principles of organizational governance, and the fiduciary duty to protect organizational assets when incapacity renders a fiduciary unable to perform their duties.

URGENCY: This removal is effective immediately upon receipt of this notice. Any delays in implementation could result in unauthorized access to organizational funds by an incapacitated individual, creating potential liability for the bank.

Please contact me immediately upon completion of these actions at the contact information provided above. I am available to meet in person to complete any additional paperwork or provide further documentation as needed.

Under penalty of perjury, I affirm that I have the legal authority to make this request,
