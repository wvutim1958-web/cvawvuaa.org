Subject: CVCWVUAA Board Position - We Need Your Leadership, David!

Hi David,

I hope you and the boss (your pup) are doing well! It was great meeting you at the Robert Morris Game Watch, and I've been thinking about our conversation ever since.

I'm reaching out because our Central Virginia Chapter is at a critical juncture, and I believe you could be exactly the leader we need to help turn things around.

THE SITUATION:
When no one else stepped up to serve on the board, I reluctantly took on the president role in July. What I inherited has been eye-opening, to put it mildly:

• Our treasurer kept no records for the past 3 years - we have no idea who's paid dues and who hasn't
• Some members haven't paid dues in 2-3 years with no follow-up
• The scholarship fund in Morgantown reports receiving NO donations since July 2022
• We lost our website and domain (cvcwvuaa.org) because bills weren't paid
• The entire board stepped down, leaving us with virtually no leadership structure

THE PROGRESS:
Despite these challenges, I've been working to rebuild our foundation:
✓ Created a comprehensive membership database system to track everything properly
✓ Built a new website from scratch at https://cvawvuaa.org with member management features
✓ Implemented content management systems for easy updates
✓ Working to organize game watches and plan our Christmas party/annual meeting
✓ Reconstructing our financial records and accountability systems

WHY I NEED YOU:
David, I remember you expressing interest in getting more involved, and frankly, I need to take you up on that offer. We have several board positions that would benefit from your skills:

• Secretary - Help document our progress and maintain meeting records
• Treasurer - Bring accountability and proper financial management (with my new systems)
• Event Coordinator - Help organize watch parties and social events
• Membership Chair - Work with the database system to engage our alumni base

Richmond has incredible potential - we just need committed people who care about making our chapter successful.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
This isn't just about filling positions; it's about being part of rebuilding something meaningful. With the systems I've created and dedicated board members like yourself, we can make this chapter stronger than it's ever been.

IMMEDIATE NEEDS:
• UCF Game Watch planning (waiting for kick-off time announcement)
• Christmas party/annual meeting coordination  
• Membership dues outreach using our new database
• Re-establishing our scholarship fund contributions

ABOUT THOSE T-SHIRTS:
You mentioned wanting 4X shirts - I found some options in our inherited inventory:
• 2 blue 3XL long sleeve (100% poly dry-fit - these run large)
• 2 yellow 3XL short sleeve (100% cotton - will shrink some)

The blue poly ones might work well since they're generously sized.

THE ASK:
David, would you consider joining our board? I can't promise it will be easy, but I can promise it will be meaningful. We have the tools now - we just need good people willing to use them.

Can we grab coffee sometime this week to discuss how you might want to get involved? I'd love to hear your thoughts and show you the systems I've built.

Looking forward to hearing from you, and hope to see you at the UCF watch party once they announce the time!

Warmest regards,

Timothy Casten
President, CVCWVUAA

P.S. - The new website really does look great, and the administrative tools will make board service much more manageable than it has been in the past. I'd love to give you a demo!
