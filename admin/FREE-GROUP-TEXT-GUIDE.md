## Alternative: Text Them Individually (5 minutes)

If you don't want everyone seeing each other's numbers:

1. Copy your message once
2. Send individual text to each person
3. Takes ~30 seconds per person = 5 minutes total

**Message template:**
```
Hey [NAME], it's Tim from CVCWVUAA! 

Game Watch THIS Saturday vs Colorado at NOON at Kickback Jack's (Midlothian Tpk). 

Chapter is providing FREE pizza & wings! 

Can you make it?

## When You Should Consider Paid SMS Service

Only consider paying for an SMS service if:
- ❌ You have 50+ people to text regularly
- ❌ You send texts weekly
- ❌ You want professional sender name (not your personal number)

For **10 people, 1-2 times per month** → Your phone is perfect!
