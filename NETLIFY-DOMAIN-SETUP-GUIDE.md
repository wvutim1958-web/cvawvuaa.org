## ‚è±Ô∏è TIME REQUIRED

- **Setup Time:** 15 minutes
- **DNS Propagation:** 15 minutes to 4 hours
- **Total:** Usually working within 1 hour

### PART 2: Update DNS in Bluehost (10 minutes)

1. **Log into Bluehost**
   - Go to: [https://www.bluehost.com](https://www.bluehost.com)
   - Click **Login** (top right)
   - Enter your credentials

2. **Navigate to DNS Settings**
   - Click **Domains** in the left sidebar
   - Click **Manage** (or **Domain Management**)
   - Find **cvcwvuaa.org** in your list
   - Click the **‚öôÔ∏è** icon or **Manage** button next to it
   - Look for **DNS** or **DNS Zone Editor** or **Advanced DNS**

3. **Delete Old Records** (Important!)
   - Find any existing **A Records** for `@` or blank host
   - Find any existing **CNAME Records** for `www`
   - Delete these old records (they point to old WordPress hosting)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't delete MX records** (email) or TXT records

4. **Add New A Record** (for root domain)
   - Click **Add Record** or **Add DNS Record**
   - Fill in:
     ```
     Type: A
     Host: @ (or leave blank, or type "cvcwvuaa.org")
     Points to / Value: 75.2.60.5
     TTL: 14400 (or 4 hours, or automatic)
     ```
   - Click **Save** or **Add Record**

5. **Add New CNAME Record** (for www)
   - Click **Add Record** again
   - Fill in:
     ```
     Type: CNAME
     Host: www
     Points to / Value: cvawvuaa.org.
     TTL: 14400 (or 4 hours, or automatic)
     ```
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note the trailing dot** after `.org.` - this is important!
   - Click **Save** or **Add Record**

6. **Verify Your Changes**
   - Your DNS records should now show:
     - `A` ‚Üí `@` ‚Üí `75.2.60.5`
     - `CNAME` ‚Üí `www` ‚Üí `cvawvuaa.org.`
   - Click **Save All Changes** if there's a final save button

---

### PART 3: Enable SSL in Netlify (Automatic)

1. **Return to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go back to your site's **Domain settings** page
   - Scroll to the **HTTPS** section

2. **Verify DNS Configuration**
   - Click **Verify DNS configuration**
   - Netlify will check if your Bluehost DNS is pointing correctly
   - ‚è≥ If it says "DNS not configured yet" - wait 10-15 minutes and try again

3. **Enable HTTPS** (usually automatic)
   - Once DNS is verified, Netlify will auto-provision an SSL certificate
   - This takes 1-5 minutes
   - You'll see a status change to **Certificate active** or similar

4. **Force HTTPS** (recommended)
   - Find the setting **Force HTTPS** or **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**
   - Toggle it **ON**
   - This ensures all traffic uses secure HTTPS

---

## ‚úÖ TESTING & VERIFICATION

### Wait for DNS Propagation
- **Minimum wait:** 15 minutes
- **Average wait:** 1-2 hours
- **Maximum wait:** 48 hours (rare)

### Test Your Domain

After waiting at least 15 minutes:

1. **Open Incognito/Private Browser Window** (avoids cache)

2. **Test these URLs:**
   - ‚úÖ `http://cvcwvuaa.org` ‚Üí should redirect to HTTPS
   - ‚úÖ `https://cvcwvuaa.org` ‚Üí should show your site
   - ‚úÖ `http://www.cvcwvuaa.org` ‚Üí should redirect to HTTPS
   - ‚úÖ `https://www.cvcwvuaa.org` ‚Üí should show your site
   - ‚úÖ Look for green padlock üîí in browser

3. **Check DNS Propagation:**
   - Go to: [https://dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org)
   - Enter: `cvcwvuaa.org`
   - Should show IP: `75.2.60.5` in most/all locations
   - Green checkmarks = propagated ‚úÖ

4. **Verify Both Domains Work:**
   - `cvawvuaa.org` ‚Üí your site ‚úÖ
   - `cvcwvuaa.org` ‚Üí your site ‚úÖ
   - Both should show identical content

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### "DNS not configured" in Netlify
- **Wait longer** - DNS takes time to propagate
- Check your A record points to `75.2.60.5` exactly
- Check your CNAME has trailing dot: `cvawvuaa.org.`
- Try **Verify DNS configuration** button again after 30 mins

### "This site can't be reached" or timeout error
- DNS hasn't propagated yet - wait 1-2 hours
- Check [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) - if not green everywhere, wait
- Clear your browser cache or use Incognito mode
- Try from your phone (different network)

### Certificate/SSL error or "Not secure"
- SSL takes 5-10 minutes after DNS propagates
- In Netlify, go to **Domain settings** ‚Üí **HTTPS**
- Click **Provision certificate** if it's not automatic
- Wait 5-10 minutes and reload the page

### Old WordPress site still shows
- Your browser has cached the old site
- Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows)
- Use Incognito/Private mode
- Wait for DNS to fully propagate (up to 24 hours)

### "Already claimed by another account"
- Someone else may have added this domain to Netlify
- Contact Netlify support to claim ownership
- You may need to verify via DNS TXT record

---

## üé® OPTIONAL: Set Primary Domain

After both domains are working, you can choose which one is "primary":

1. In Netlify **Domain settings**
2. Find **Primary domain** section
3. Choose either:
   - `cvawvuaa.org` (current) - **RECOMMENDED**
   - `cvcwvuaa.org` (old domain)
4. The non-primary domain will auto-redirect to primary

**Recommendation:** Keep `cvawvuaa.org` as primary (it's shorter and current)

---

## üí∞ COST SAVINGS AFTER SETUP

Once both domains work on Netlify:

### Can Cancel from Bluehost:
- ‚ùå WordPress hosting ($5-30/month saved!)
- ‚ùå SSL certificate (Netlify provides free SSL)
- ‚ùå Website builder tools

### Must Keep with Bluehost:
- ‚úÖ **Domain registration** for cvcwvuaa.org (~$15/year)
  - You're just changing DNS, not canceling the domain!

### How to Cancel WordPress Hosting:
1. Wait 30 days after DNS change (to ensure it works)
2. Log into Bluehost
3. Go to **Hosting** ‚Üí **Manage**
4. Cancel hosting plan (but keep domain registration)
5. **Important:** Tell them "I only want to keep the domain registration, cancel hosting"

- [ ] Both domains load your site:
