## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Import Issues:

**"Firebase not connected"**
- Refresh the page
- Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase credentials

**"No members showing after import"**
- Go to Member Database
- Click refresh or reload page
- Check Firebase console to verify data

**"Some members missing family names"**
- This is normal - not all CSV entries had clear family member patterns
- Manually edit those members to add family names

**"Status seems wrong"**
- Import uses payment dates to determine active/inactive
- Active = paid within last 2 years
- Manually adjust status if needed using Edit feature
