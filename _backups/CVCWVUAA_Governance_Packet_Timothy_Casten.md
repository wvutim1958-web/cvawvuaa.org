A) BOARD RESOLUTION — CONTINUITY & SOLE-DIRECTOR AUTHORITY
============================================================

Title: Resolution Confirming Continuity of Governance and Authority
Date: October 28, 2025

WHEREAS, on December 20, 2024, the then-current Board announced resignations effective June 30, 2025; and
WHEREAS, prior to those resignations, the President nominated Timothy Casten to fill the presidential vacancy and the Board confirmed that nomination, satisfying Article IV, Section 12, Paragraph 3 of the Chapter Bylaws; and
WHEREAS, following June 30, 2025, vacancies left one director in office; and
WHEREAS, Article IV, Section 9 provides that a quorum is a majority of the directors then in office; thus one of one constitutes a quorum for board action;

RESOLVED:
1) Timothy Casten is confirmed as the duly seated President and sole director with full authority to exercise all corporate powers until successors are elected or appointed consistent with the bylaws and Virginia law.
2) All reasonable acts taken to preserve assets and keep the Chapter in good standing since June 30, 2025, are hereby approved and ratified.

B) BOARD RESOLUTION — APPOINTMENT OF INTERIM OFFICERS
============================================================

Title: Resolution Appointing Interim Officers to Fill Vacancies
Date: October 28, 2025

AUTHORITY: Article IV, Section 12, ¶3 authorizes the President to nominate members to fill unexpired officer terms, subject to board confirmation; with one director in office the quorum rule in Art. IV §9 allows confirmation. Officers are ordinarily elected by members in odd/even year cycles (President/Secretary in odd years; VP/Treasurer in even years). Appointees serve until the next member election for that office.

RESOLVED: Effective immediately, the following interim appointments are made to serve until the next applicable member election or a successor is elected:
• Vice President: Timothy Casten (interim)
• Treasurer: Timothy Casten (interim)
• Secretary: Timothy Casten (interim)

Rationale: No other members are willing to serve at this time; continuity of fiduciary functions is necessary.

1) The Chapter’s bank accounts shall list Timothy Casten as authorized signer.
2) Under Article VI §2, the Treasurer is authorized as sole signatory for routine disbursements up to $2,500; amounts above that threshold require written approval by the President (may be same person) and documentation in the minutes.

E) MEMBER STATUS UPDATE (NO MEETING)
============================================================

Subject: Central Virginia WVU Alumni Chapter — Governance & Operations Update

Dear Members,

This note confirms that, as announced last December, the prior Board’s resignations became effective June 30, 2025. Before resigning, they nominated and confirmed Timothy Casten to serve as President under our bylaws’ vacancy provision (Article IV §12 ¶3).

Since July 1, 2025, the Chapter has operated under a reduced board. The bylaws define a Board quorum as a majority of directors then in office (Article IV §9), allowing essential business to continue while we recruit additional directors.

I will continue operations (events, filings, and finances) and will announce any member meeting with at least 10 days’ notice (Article X §7).

If you are willing to serve as a director or officer, reply to this email. Light commitment, quarterly meetings, and clear roles.

Gold & Blue,
Timothy Casten
President, Central Virginia Chapter WVUAA

I) EMAIL TO WVU ALUMNI ASSOCIATION — KEVIN BERRY & KATLIN BEAGLE
============================================================

To: <kevin.berry@wvu.edu>; <katlin.beagle@wvu.edu>
Subject: Central Virginia WVUAA — Governance Continuity & Caretaker Status

Kevin and Katlin,

This is to confirm the governance status of the Central Virginia WVU Alumni Chapter:

• On Dec 20, 2024, the prior board announced resignations effective June 30, 2025.
• Prior to that date, I was nominated and confirmed as President under Article IV §12 ¶3 of our bylaws.
• As of July 1, 2025, I have served as the sole director. Our bylaws define board quorum as a majority of directors then in office (Article IV §9), allowing essential business to continue while we recruit new directors.

Today I have executed the enclosed board resolutions to:
1) Ratify continuity of authority and past necessary acts,
2) Appoint myself interim VP, Treasurer, and Secretary to maintain operations until volunteers are available, consistent with the vacancy provision and quorum rule,
3) Update banking authority per Article VI §2, authorize the Treasurer as sole signatory for routine disbursements, and
4) Consolidate digital access, change passwords, and enforce 2FA across all Chapter systems.

We will continue operating in caretaker status (quarterly reports, events as feasible, filings current) while seeking additional directors. If participation remains low, I may call a Special Meeting of Members to consider temporary bylaw amendments that formalize a short-term “board-of-one” fallback, with a sunset to June 30, 2027.

Please update WVUAA records to reflect:
• President: Timothy Casten — 804-566-8058 / tcasten@gmail.com / 4701 Stoney Creek Parkway, Chester, VA 23831
• Board seats vacant (recruiting).
• Primary chapter admin email: cvcwvuaa.admin@gmail.com

I’ll share any member-meeting notices or amendments in advance. Thank you for any assistance with a membership outreach to identify volunteers in Central Virginia.

Best regards,
Timothy Casten
President & Director, Central Virginia Chapter WVU Alumni Association, Inc.

J) CONTINUITY & AUTHORITY CERTIFICATION (FOR BANK/PAYPAL)
