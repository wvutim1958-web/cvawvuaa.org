## üìã Overview

The Alumni Spotlight feature celebrates outstanding WVU alumni in Central Virginia through short profiles highlighting their achievements, community involvement, and Mountaineer spirit.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- Encourage chapter engagement and pride
- Provide role models for current students and recent graduates
- Build stronger connections within the alumni network

---

## üìù Content Pipeline

### 1. **Submission** (Public-Facing)

**URL:** `/alumni-spotlight-submit.html`

**How It Works:**
- Anyone can nominate an alumnus (including self-nominations)
- Form collects: alumnus name, graduation year, location, category, story, contact info, photo
- Submissions go to your email via Formspree (free for 50 submissions/month)

**Setup Required:**
1. Create a free Formspree account at https://formspree.io
2. Create a new form
3. Copy your form ID (looks like `xyzabc123`)
4. Update line 98 in `alumni-spotlight-submit.html`:
   ```html
   <form id="spotlightForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree ID

---

### 2. **Review & Approval** (Board/Admin)

**Process:**
1. Receive submission notification email from Formspree
2. Review the nomination:
   - Is the story compelling?
   - Does it reflect WVU values?
   - Is the information accurate?
3. Contact the alumnus (if not self-submitted) to:
   - Get their permission
   - Request a professional photo
   - Gather additional quotes/details
4. Edit for clarity and length (2-3 sentences ideal)

**Approval Criteria:**
‚úÖ Current or recent chapter member preferred  
‚úÖ Demonstrates leadership, service, or achievement  
‚úÖ Story is specific and inspiring  
‚úÖ Photo available (high-quality, professional preferred)  
‚ùå Reject if inappropriate, unverifiable, or too vague
