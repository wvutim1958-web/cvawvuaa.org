# Testing the Member Login Button

## How to Test

1. **Open the member portal page:**
   - Open `member-portal.html` in your web browser
   - OR use the dedicated test page at `test-member-login.html`

2. **Test the login button:**
   - Click the "üîê Member Login" button in the top section
   - OR click the "üîê Test Login" button in the demo accounts section
   - OR use the "üöÄ Full Test" link to go to the comprehensive test page

3. **Check for errors:**
   - Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to the Console tab
   - Look for any error messages

## Expected Behavior

When you click the login button:
1. Console should show debug messages starting with "=== Login button clicked ==="
2. A login modal should appear with email and password fields
3. The modal should have "Login" and "Cancel" buttons
4. You should see success messages in the console

## Demo Accounts

You can test login with these accounts:
- **Regular Member:** member@cvawvuaa.org / member123
- **Premium Member:** premium@cvawvuaa.org / premium123
- **Board Member:** board@cvawvuaa.org / board123

## Troubleshooting

If the login button shows "Please wait a moment and try again":
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Use the test page at `test-member-login.html` for detailed diagnostics

## Files Modified

The following files were updated to fix the login button:
- `js/member-portal.js` - Fixed initialization and added debugging
- `member-portal.html` - Enhanced login button handler and debugging
- `test-member-login.html` - New comprehensive test page

## Debug Information

The system now provides detailed console logging to help identify any issues:
- Portal availability checks
