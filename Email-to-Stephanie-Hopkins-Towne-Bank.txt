Dear Rachel Taylor, Branch Manager, and Iron Bridge Commercial Banking Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing regarding the Central Virginia Chapter West Virginia University Alumni Association (CVCWVUAA) Community Partner Checking Account #00290001686. Stephanie Hopkins from your Midlothian Branch assisted me on September 18, 2025, adding me to this account following Towne Bank's acquisition of Village Bank. Since Stephanie is out of the office and your Iron Bridge location is much closer to my home in Chester, I am reaching out to request your assistance with urgent account changes and compliance matters.

I have discovered serious compliance problems related to our scholarship fund that create potential legal liability for our 501(c)(3) organization. The attached formal letters detail the critical need for historical Village Bank records and immediate signatory changes due to incapacity issues with our former Treasurer, David Haines, following his 2022 traumatic brain injury. We have identified that scholarship donations may not have been properly forwarded to the WVU Foundation, creating IRS compliance concerns that must be addressed immediately.

IMMEDIATE ACCOUNT CHANGES NEEDED:
- Remove David Haines as Signer 1 (incapacitated due to TBI)
- Move Timothy Casten from Signer 2 to Signer 1 (President)
- No other signers at this time
- Update account address to: CVC WVU AA Timothy Casten, 4701 Stoney Creek Parkway, Chester, Virginia 23831
- CRITICAL: Access to historical Village Bank online records for scholarship fund compliance

Additionally, due to the proximity of the Iron Bridge location to our chapter headquarters and my residence, CVCWVUAA would like all of our banking and account management to be moved to the Iron Bridge branch going forward. This will make it much easier for our organization to handle banking matters and maintain regular contact with your team.

For further clarity, David Haines is no longer a board member of CVCWVUAA. The previous board, including Mr. Haines, officially resigned effective June 30th, as announced by our past president Jennifer Condaras (see attached announcement). I am now the sole acting board member and President of the organization.

I plan to visit your Iron Bridge branch this morning between 10:00 and 10:30 AM to present these formal requests and complete the necessary paperwork. Given the time-sensitive nature of the tax compliance issues and the need to protect our organization's assets, I hope we can expedite these account changes and records requests.

I appreciate your team's assistance with resolving these critical matters and look forward to meeting with you this morning. Given the commercial nature of our nonprofit organization and the compliance complexities involved, I hope to work with your commercial account officers to ensure proper handling of these urgent matters.

Best regards,

Timothy Casten
President, CVCWVUAA
