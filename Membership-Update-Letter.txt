Subject: CVCWVUAA October 2025 Newsletter - Chapter Update, Upcoming Events & Important Member Survey

Dear CVCWVUAA Members,

As your President, I want to provide a comprehensive October update about our chapter's status, upcoming activities, and opportunities for you to get involved. Most importantly, please complete our member survey - we need your input!

THE SITUATION WE INHERITED:
When I assumed the presidency in August, I discovered significant challenges with our chapter's financial records and operations:

• No dues deposits have been made to our bank account throughout 2025
• Financial records from the past three years are incomplete or missing  
• Our membership database was outdated and contained gaps
• Communication with members regarding dues had largely ceased
• No scholarship fund donations have been sent to WVU since June 28, 2022

WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR:
Since August, I have been working to restore our chapter's foundation:

✓ Built a new comprehensive member management system
✓ Reconstructed our website with modern features and member portal
✓ Analyzed all PayPal transactions to identify payment patterns
✓ Created systems for dues tracking, receipt generation, and member communications
✓ Established proper record-keeping procedures going forward
✓ **Restored scholarship fund operations** - coordinated directly with WVU Foundation to get our Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship back on track
✓ **Updated all WVU records** with current chapter contact information and leadership
✓ **Secured scholarship fund details** - our endowment currently stands at $66,475.55 with projected annual awards of $1,500-$2,500
✓ **Scheduled WVU Foundation meeting** - traveling to Morgantown on Monday, October 7th, to meet with Foundation and Alumni personnel about chapter revitalization
✓ **Preparing major scholarship donation** - presenting a $5,000 check to our Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship (approved by past president and board members)
✓ **Processing generous member gift** - presenting an additional $600 donation from a dedicated member

THE TRANSITION CHALLENGES:
In December 2024, then-President Jennifer Condaras announced that the entire board would be stepping down in June 2025 to allow fresh leadership to energize the chapter. After meeting with Jennifer in July 2025, I agreed to step forward as President when no other members volunteered for board positions. Jennifer officially announced my presidency in August 2025.

**IMPORTANT:** The entire board officially resigned in June 2025 as announced. While several former board members have graciously attended a couple of Zoom transition meetings to help with the handover, they are no longer board members. I am currently operating as the sole chapter officer, which is why board recruitment is absolutely critical for our future operations.

However, during this leadership transition, we discovered significant operational challenges. Our previous treasurer, David Haines, had suffered a serious car accident and traumatic brain injury in 2022. While we are grateful he recovered, this medical situation significantly impacted his ability to maintain the detailed financial records required for our 501(c)(3) organization. The outgoing board, while well-intentioned, did not adequately address the resulting gaps in record-keeping and dues collection during the three-year period following his injury.

This is not about blame—it's about acknowledging where we are and focusing on solutions.

CURRENT FINANCIAL STATUS:
Based on PayPal records and recent collections:
• Only 16 members have paid 2025 dues (13 via PayPal, 3 by check)
• Many longtime supporters appear to have stopped receiving dues notices
• Chapter operating account currently has $15,000 with ~$1,500 in pending deposits
• No deposits were made from January through August 2025
• **Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship Fund** at WVU Foundation: $66,475.55 current value (no chapter donations since June 2022)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN:
1. **Dues Recovery Campaign:** Mailing postal notices to all members who appear overdue
2. **Database Reconstruction:** Reaching out to former active members who may have been lost from our records
3. **Financial Reconciliation:** Working to recover and organize all available financial documents
4. **WVU Foundation Partnership:** Meeting in Morgantown on Monday, October 6th, with Kevin Berry and David Alloway from the Foundation and Alumni Association to explore chapter revitalization strategies
5. **Major Scholarship Donation:** Presenting a $5,000 contribution plus a $600 member donation to our Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship (Fund #3s844)
6. **Transparency:** Regular updates on our progress and financial status
7. **New Board Recruitment:** Seeking dedicated volunteers to help rebuild our leadership team

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
• **If you've already paid 2025 dues:** Thank you! You're all set.
• **If you haven't paid 2025 dues:** You'll receive a notice with payment options soon.
• **If you've been trying to pay:** Our new systems make it much easier—visit [website] or mail a check.
• **If you want to help:** We desperately need board members and volunteers.

LOOKING FORWARD:
OUR TRUE MISSION AND PURPOSE:
It's important to remember that while our watch parties, get-togethers, and social events are wonderful for staying connected as Mountaineers, **the real reason our chapter exists is to provide educational support for area youth through our Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship.** Our primary mission is to collect funds for the WVU Foundation and, in particular, to keep funding our chapter's scholarship that helps deserving students achieve their educational dreams.

Every dollar we collect in dues, every donation we receive, and every fundraising effort we undertake should ultimately serve this higher purpose of helping the next generation of Mountaineers succeed.

Despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about our chapter's future. We have:
• A strong foundation of loyal Mountaineers in Central Virginia who understand our educational mission
• Modern systems now in place for proper management and scholarship fund tracking
• Renewed energy and commitment to excellence in serving students
• Opportunities to reconnect with supporters who share our scholarship mission

OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU:
• Complete transparency about our financial situation
• Proper stewardship of all chapter funds
• Regular communication and updates
• Professional management of your membership and donations
• Restoration of regular contributions to our Blake E. Fought Memorial Scholarship at WVU (which can award $1,500-$2,500 annually to deserving students)

I know this isn't the update anyone wanted to hear, but I believe in being honest about where we stand so we can move forward together. Our chapter has survived and thrived for years because of dedicated Mountaineers like you.

With your continued support and participation, we will emerge from this transition period stronger than ever. We're not just rebuilding systems - we're rebuilding trust, engagement, and the Mountaineer spirit that makes our chapter special.

Thank you for your patience and support during this rebuilding phase. Together, we will restore our chapter to the level of excellence our members deserve.

Let's Go Mountaineers!
