    <div class="subject-line">
        RE: URGENT - CVCWVUAA Account Access, Historical Records, and Signatory Changes
    </div>

    <p class="body-text">Dear Branch Manager,</p>

    <p class="body-text">
        I am writing as the duly elected President of the Central Virginia Chapter of the West Virginia University Alumni Association (CVCWVUAA) regarding critical banking matters that require immediate attention following your institution's acquisition of Village Bank in June 2025.
    </p>

    <div class="urgent-notice">
        <strong>IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:</strong> This letter serves as official notice of organizational changes and requests urgent assistance with account access and management.
    </div>

    <h3>CURRENT ORGANIZATIONAL STATUS</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        As of October 2025, CVCWVUAA has undergone significant organizational restructuring. I, Timothy Casten, am the sole remaining Board Member serving as President. All other board positions, including the Treasurer position previously held by David Haines, are vacant due to resignations and incapacity issues detailed below.
    </p>

    <h3>CRITICAL ISSUE: ACCESS TO HISTORICAL BANKING RECORDS</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        Following Towne Bank's acquisition of Village Bank, our organization can only access banking records from June 1, 2025, forward through your online banking system. However, we urgently require access to our complete banking history from the former Village Bank system to reconstruct our financial records and fulfill our fiduciary responsibilities to our membership.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>Former Village Bank Login Credentials:</strong> The previous Treasurer, David Haines, provided the following login information for the Village Bank online system, though we are unable to locate the proper access portal:
    </p>

    <div class="credentials-section">
        <strong>Village Bank Online Banking Credentials:</strong><br>
        Username: CVCWVUAA<br>
        Password: F8uggBi@yuDg<br><br>
        <strong>Security Challenge Questions:</strong><br>
        1. Favorite sports team: mountaineers<br>
        2. What did you want to be when you grew up: happy<br>
        3. Favorite song: countryroads
    </div>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>REQUEST:</strong> We need Towne Bank to either provide access to the historical Village Bank records through your systems or assist us in accessing the archived Village Bank online portal to retrieve bank statements and transaction histories dating back as far as available.
    </p>

    <h3>SIGNATORY CHANGES AND CARD CANCELLATIONS</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        Due to circumstances detailed below, we require immediate changes to our account:
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>1. REMOVE SIGNATORY:</strong> David Haines must be immediately removed as a signatory and authorized user on all CVCWVUAA accounts. Mr. Haines suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2022 that has significantly impacted his cognitive abilities and capacity to handle financial responsibilities. He has resigned from his Treasurer position and all board duties.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>2. CANCEL DEBIT CARDS:</strong> All debit cards issued to David Haines for both the former Village Bank account and any Towne Bank cards must be cancelled immediately upon receipt of this notice for security purposes.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>3. SOLE SIGNATORY:</strong> Timothy Casten (President) should be established as the primary and sole signatory until additional board members are elected and proper documentation is provided.
    </p>

    <h3>CRITICAL LEGAL ISSUE: SCHOLARSHIP FUND MISMANAGEMENT</h3>
    <div class="urgent-notice">
        <strong>URGENT COMPLIANCE MATTER:</strong> Potential violation of 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and donor tax deduction rights.
    </div>
    
    <p class="body-text">
        A critical issue has been discovered that requires immediate investigation and remediation. The CVCWVUAA operates the <strong>Blake E. Found Scholarship Fund</strong>, a fully funded endowment with a current market value exceeding $65,000, established to provide educational assistance to deserving students at West Virginia University.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> Over the past three years (2022-2025), members have made donations to CVCWVUAA via check, often contributing amounts exceeding the $25 annual dues specifically to support the scholarship fund. These donors claimed tax deductions for their charitable contributions to our 501(c)(3) organization, as is their legal right under IRC Section 170.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>COMPLIANCE VIOLATION:</strong> Investigation reveals that while former Treasurer David Haines properly deposited these checks into the CVCWVUAA account, <em>no corresponding transfers were made to the WVU Foundation scholarship account</em>. This creates several serious legal issues:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><strong>IRS Compliance (26 USC ยง501(c)(3)):</strong> Failure to use donated funds for stated charitable purposes</li>
        <li><strong>Donor Reliance (26 USC ยง170):</strong> Donors claimed legitimate tax deductions based on our representations</li>
        <li><strong>Fiduciary Duty:</strong> Breach of trust regarding restricted donations</li>
        <li><strong>State Charitable Organization Law:</strong> Potential violation of Virginia charitable solicitation requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>LEGAL AUTHORITY:</strong> Under Treasury Regulation 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(1)(ii), organizations must operate exclusively for exempt purposes. The failure to forward scholarship donations as promised constitutes a diversion of charitable assets, potentially jeopardizing our tax-exempt status under IRC Section 501(c)(3).
    </p>

    <h3>ORGANIZATIONAL REBUILDING CONTEXT</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        The CVCWVUAA is currently in a rebuilding phase due to the challenges created by the previous Treasurer's diminished capacity following his 2022 accident. The organization's financial records were not properly maintained during this period, creating significant gaps in our institutional knowledge. Access to complete banking records is essential for:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Reconstructing accurate financial statements for our membership</li>
        <li><strong>Identifying and quantifying scholarship donations requiring transfer to WVU Foundation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Calculating interest and penalties owed on delayed scholarship transfers</strong></li>
        <li>Ensuring proper stewardship of member dues and donations</li>
        <li>Meeting our fiduciary obligations as a 501(c)(3) organization</li>
        <li><strong>Preparing corrective action plan for IRS compliance</strong></li>
        <li>Preparing for the election of new board members</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>REQUESTED ACTIONS - URGENT COMPLIANCE MATTER</h3>
    <p class="body-text">
        Due to the serious nature of the scholarship fund compliance issues and our legal obligations under federal tax law, we respectfully request that Towne Bank take the following actions immediately:
    </p>

    <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li><strong>PRIORITY:</strong> Provide immediate access to historical Village Bank records for the CVCWVUAA account with detailed transaction descriptions to identify scholarship donations</li>
        <li><strong>PRIORITY:</strong> Generate comprehensive deposit analysis report showing all check deposits exceeding $25 from 2022-2025 with memo line details</li>
        <li>Remove David Haines as signatory and authorized user</li>
        <li>Cancel all debit cards issued to David Haines</li>
        <li>Establish Timothy Casten as sole signatory</li>
        <li>Provide comprehensive account statements from the earliest available date</li>
        <li>Flag account for enhanced monitoring during compliance remediation period</li>
        <li>Schedule emergency meeting to discuss account management and compliance documentation needs</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>TIME SENSITIVITY:</strong> Under IRC Section 501(c)(3) and Treasury Regulation 1.501(c)(3)-1, we have a legal obligation to remedy this situation promptly to maintain our tax-exempt status and protect donor rights. The banking records are essential evidence for our corrective action plan and potential voluntary disclosure to the IRS.</p>

    <p class="body-text">
        This situation requires urgent attention as we are working to restore proper governance and financial transparency to our organization. I am available to meet in person at your Midlothian Turnpike branch at your earliest convenience to provide additional documentation and complete any necessary paperwork.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        Thank you for your prompt attention to these critical matters. Please contact me directly at the information provided above to schedule a meeting or if you require any additional documentation.
    </p>

    <p class="body-text">
        <strong>LEGAL NOTICE:</strong> This letter serves as official notice under applicable banking regulations, Virginia charitable organization statutes, and federal tax compliance requirements. We request written confirmation of all actions taken in response to these requests.
