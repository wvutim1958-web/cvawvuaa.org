## RATIONALE FOR AMENDMENT

**Purpose:** These amendments address the practical reality that small volunteer chapters may experience periods when insufficient volunteers are available to fill all traditional officer positions. Rather than suspend operations or operate in technical violation of bylaws, this amendment provides a legal framework for continued operations while maintaining appropriate financial controls and accountability.

**Key Protections:**
- Mandatory financial documentation and reporting
- Expenditure thresholds requiring membership notification
- Ongoing recruitment obligations
- Annual reporting to membership
- Maintains fiscal responsibility and transparency

**Precedent:** Many small nonprofit organizations operate with consolidated officer positions. This amendment brings our bylaws in line with common nonprofit governance practices while maintaining member oversight.

**Current Situation:** The previous Board resigned effective June 30, 2025. Only one member volunteered to serve. This amendment will allow the Chapter to continue serving members while recruiting additional Board members.

---

## ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS

Pursuant to Article XI, Section 2 of the Bylaws, this amendment may be adopted by:

**EITHER:**
1. Unanimous vote of the Board of Directors (currently satisfied), **AND/OR**
2. Majority vote of Chapter members present in person or by proxy at the Annual Business Meeting at which the required quorum (20% of members) is present

**Notice Requirement:** Written notice including this proposed amendment must be provided to all members at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting pursuant to Article X, Section 7.

---

## IMPLEMENTATION

If adopted, this amendment shall take effect immediately and shall:

1. Ratify the current officer arrangement established by Board Resolution 2025-01
2. Provide ongoing legal framework for officer consolidation when necessary
3. Require no additional action by current officers
4. Remain in effect unless and until further amended by the membership
