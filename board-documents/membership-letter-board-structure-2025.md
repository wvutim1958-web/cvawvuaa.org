# LETTER TO MEMBERSHIP
## Regarding Board Structure and Operations

**Central Virginia Chapter of the WVU Alumni Association, Inc.**

**Date:** October 28, 2025

**To:** All Members of the Central Virginia Chapter

**From:** Timothy Casten, President

**Subject:** Important Update on Chapter Board Structure and Leadership

---

Dear Fellow Mountaineers,

I am writing to you today to provide an important update about our Chapter's Board structure and to explain some necessary governance decisions that ensure we can continue serving our alumni community effectively.

## WHAT HAPPENED

On June 30, 2025, the previous Board of Directors submitted their resignations, leaving all officer positions vacant. This was not due to any conflict or problem with the Chapter itself, but rather personal circumstances and time commitments that made continued service difficult for those individuals. We are grateful for their past service and wish them well.

Following these resignations, I stepped forward and was elected as President. I did so because I believe deeply in the mission of our Chapter and the importance of maintaining a vibrant WVU alumni community here in Central Virginia.

However, despite extensive outreach and recruitment efforts over the past four months, I have not been able to recruit additional volunteers to fill the other required Board positions: Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer.

## THE CHALLENGE

Our Chapter Bylaws, adopted in 2018, were written with the assumption that we would always have multiple volunteers willing to serve on the Board. They require four distinct officer positions: President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer.

This creates a problem: if we cannot fill all four positions, we technically cannot operate in full compliance with our own Bylaws, even though we have an active membership, successful events, and ongoing programs.

## THE SOLUTION

After careful review of our Bylaws and consultation regarding nonprofit governance best practices, I have taken the following actions to ensure legal compliance and continued operations:

**1. BOARD RESOLUTION (Effective Immediately)**

I have passed a Board Resolution appointing myself to serve concurrently as:
- President
- Treasurer  
- Secretary

This is a temporary measure that allows the Chapter to continue operations legally while we continue recruiting additional Board members. The resolution includes important safeguards:

- All expenditures over $500 will be documented with written justification
- Monthly financial statements will be prepared and maintained
- Annual financial reports will be presented to the membership
- Ongoing recruitment efforts will continue
- Status updates will be provided at each Annual Business Meeting

**2. PROPOSED BYLAW AMENDMENT (For Your Vote)**

I am preparing a formal Bylaw amendment for your consideration at our next Annual Business Meeting. This amendment will update our Bylaws to reflect the reality that small volunteer chapters sometimes face difficulty recruiting Board members.

The proposed amendment would:

- Allow one person to hold multiple officer positions when necessary
- Establish clear financial controls and reporting requirements
- Maintain member oversight and transparency
- Require ongoing recruitment efforts
- Keep all other Bylaw provisions intact

You will receive the full text of the proposed amendment at least 10 days before the Annual Business Meeting, and you will have the opportunity to vote on it.

## WHY THIS IS NECESSARY

I want to be completely transparent with you about why I am taking these steps:

**Without this action, the Chapter would face these problems:**

- Inability to legally sign checks or conduct financial transactions
- Inability to maintain required corporate records
- Risk of losing our nonprofit status
- Inability to host events or serve members
- Potential dissolution of the Chapter

**With this action, the Chapter can:**

- Continue hosting game watch parties and social events
- Maintain our scholarship fund and member benefits
- Keep our website, social media, and communications active
- Preserve our nonprofit status and legal standing
- Serve our members without interruption

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

**Your membership benefits do not change.** You will continue to receive:

- Access to all Chapter events and game watches
- Member directory and networking opportunities
- Scholarship opportunities for eligible students
- Communications and updates about WVU and our Chapter
- All other membership benefits

**Your dues remain the same.** There is no increase in membership costs.

**Your voice still matters.** You will vote on the Bylaw amendment at our Annual Business Meeting, and you can raise questions or concerns at any time.

**Financial transparency continues.** I will provide detailed financial reports and maintain all records for member inspection.

## THE BIGGER PICTURE

I want to emphasize something important: This situation is not unique to our Chapter. Many small volunteer organizations across the country face similar challenges. People are busy with work, family, and other commitments. Finding volunteers for nonprofit boards has become increasingly difficult nationwide.

Rather than let our Chapter fade away or operate in a gray area of compliance, I am taking proactive steps to ensure we can continue our mission legally and effectively.

## WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP

While I am capable of handling multiple officer roles temporarily, the Chapter will be stronger with more Board members. If you or someone you know might be interested in serving, please reach out.

We need:
- **Vice President:** Help with leadership and event coordination
- **Secretary:** Meeting minutes and record keeping
- **Treasurer:** Financial oversight and reporting (I can mentor you!)
- **Appointed Directors:** Communications, activities, membership

The time commitment is modest (approximately 4 to 8 hours per month), and you will be making a real difference in our alumni community.

## UPCOMING EVENTS

Despite our Board challenges, we are continuing strong programming:

- **November 1:** Houston Cougars Game Watch at Capital Ale House (Noon)
- **November 8:** Colorado Buffaloes Game Watch at Sports Page Mechanicsville (Noon)  
- **November 15:** Arizona State Game Watch at Capital Ale House Midlothian (Time TBD)

Come out and support the Mountaineers with us!

## YOUR QUESTIONS MATTER

I know this is a lot of information, and you may have questions. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly. I am committed to transparency and open communication with our membership.

Common questions I anticipate:

**Q: Is this legal?**  
A: Yes. Our Bylaws allow the Board to make decisions by unanimous vote (currently 100% agreement since I am the only Board member), and they do not explicitly prohibit one person from holding multiple offices. The proposed amendment will formalize this arrangement.

**Q: Are our finances safe?**  
A: Absolutely. I am implementing enhanced financial controls, including detailed documentation, monthly reviews, and annual reporting. All transactions are transparent and available for member inspection.

**Q: How long will this last?**  
A: As long as necessary. I am actively recruiting, and as soon as qualified volunteers come forward, we will fill positions and return to a traditional Board structure.

**Q: Can you really handle all these roles?**  
A: Yes. The Chapter's operations are manageable, especially with the strong foundation built by previous Boards. I am committed to serving our members effectively.

## IN CLOSING

I stepped up as President because I care about this Chapter and our WVU alumni community. I believe we have tremendous potential, and I am committed to ensuring we continue serving our members with excellence.

These governance changes are about legal compliance and operational efficiency. They are not about power or control. They are about making sure we can continue doing what we do best: bringing Mountaineers together.

I appreciate your understanding, your support, and your continued membership. Together, we will keep this Chapter strong and vibrant.

Let's Go Mountaineers!
