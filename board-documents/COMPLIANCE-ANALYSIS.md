# BYLAW COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS
## Operating with Just a President - Full Assessment

**Prepared:** October 28, 2025  
**Prepared For:** Timothy Casten, President  
**Subject:** Can CVCWVUAA operate with only a President?

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Short Answer:** **NO - You are NOT in full compliance** with current bylaws
operating only as President.

**However:** The situation is **fixable** through the three-step approach
already documented (Board Resolution + Bylaw Amendment + Recruitment).

---

## DETAILED COMPLIANCE REVIEW

### ‚ùå AREAS OF NON-COMPLIANCE

#### 1. ARTICLE V, SECTION 1 - OFFICER POSITIONS

**Current Bylaw Language:**
> "The elected officers of the Chapter **shall be** the President, the Vice
> President, the Secretary, and the Treasurer."

**Analysis:**
- The word "**shall be**" is mandatory, not permissive
- This requires ALL FOUR positions to exist and be filled
- You currently have ONLY the President position filled
- **VIOLATION:** Missing Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer

**Compliance Status:** ‚ùå **NOT COMPLIANT**

---

#### 2. ARTICLE VI, SECTION 2 - CHECKS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

**Current Bylaw Language:**
> "checks, drafts, promissory notes, orders for the payment of monies, and
> other evidence of indebtedness of the Chapter **shall be signed by the
> Treasurer and countersigned by the President or Vice President** of the
> Chapter unless the Board authorizes the Treasurer to act as the sole
> signatory representative of the Chapter."

**Analysis:**
- Requires DUAL SIGNATURES: Treasurer + (President OR Vice President)
- You have no Treasurer to sign
- You have no Vice President to countersign
- Alternative: Board can authorize Treasurer as sole signatory, but you have no
  Treasurer to authorize
- **VIOLATION:** Cannot execute financial instruments per bylaw requirements

**Compliance Status:** ‚ùå **NOT COMPLIANT**

---

#### 3. ARTICLE V, SECTIONS 2-5 - OFFICER DUTIES

**Bylaw Requirements:**

**Vice President (Section 3):**
- Must preside over meetings when President unavailable
- Must perform President's duties during absence/incapacity
- **VIOLATION:** Position unfilled - no succession plan

**Secretary (Section 4):**
- Must maintain minutes of all Board and membership meetings
- Must maintain corporate records and documents
- Must provide notice of meetings
- Must maintain membership roster
- **VIOLATION:** Duties being performed but no official Secretary appointed

**Treasurer (Section 5):**
- Must maintain all financial records
- Must provide financial reports to Board and membership
- Must manage deposits, withdrawals, disbursements
- Must prepare annual budget
- Must arrange for annual financial review/audit
- **VIOLATION:** Duties being performed but no official Treasurer appointed

**Compliance Status:** ‚ùå **NOT COMPLIANT**

---

### ‚úÖ AREAS WHERE YOU CAN OPERATE (WITH ASTERISKS)

#### 1. ARTICLE IV - BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION

**Bylaw Language:**
- Does NOT specify a minimum number of Board members
- Only requires that officers "shall be" filled
- President IS a Board member

**Analysis:**
- Having only 1 Board member is not explicitly prohibited
- The issue is officer positions, not Board size

**Compliance Status:** ‚úÖ **TECHNICALLY COMPLIANT** (but only 1 person)

---

#### 2. ARTICLE IV, SECTION 10 - QUORUM AND MAJORITY ACTIONS

**Bylaw Language:**
> "A majority of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
> business. Acts approved by a majority of Directors present at a meeting at
> which a quorum exists shall constitute acts of the Board."

**Analysis:**
- With 1 Board member, majority = 1 person
- With 1 Board member present, quorum = 1 person
- You CAN conduct official Board business as sole member
- You CAN pass Board resolutions

**Compliance Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**

---

#### 3. ARTICLE IV, SECTION 12 - FILLING VACANCIES

**Bylaw Language (Paragraph 3):**
> "The President may nominate one or more persons to fill any vacancies.
> Subject to confirmation by the Board, such appointees shall hold office for
> the unexpired portion of the term."

**Analysis:**
- You CAN nominate yourself to fill vacant officer positions
- As sole Board member, you CAN confirm your own nominations
- **This is the basis for Board Resolution 2025-01**

**Compliance Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT** (for appointments)

---

#### 4. ARTICLE XI, SECTION 2 - BYLAW AMENDMENTS

**Bylaw Language:**
> "These Bylaws may be amended by a unanimous vote of the Board or by a
> majority vote of the members of the Chapter present in person or by proxy at
> any Chapter meeting."

**Analysis:**
- As sole Board member, you constitute "unanimous vote"
- You CAN adopt bylaw amendments via Board action
- **This is the basis for the Proposed Bylaw Amendment**

**Compliance Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLIANT** (for amending bylaws)

---

## CRITICAL NON-COMPLIANCE ISSUES

### Issue #1: Financial Operations
**Problem:** Cannot legally sign checks per Article VI, Section 2  
**Impact:** HIGH - Cannot pay bills, issue refunds, conduct banking  
**Resolution:** Board Resolution 2025-01 + Bylaw Amendment  
**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE

### Issue #2: Corporate Records
**Problem:** No official Secretary to maintain records per Article V, Section 4  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Records exist but no authorized officer  
**Resolution:** Board Resolution 2025-01 (appoint self as Secretary)  
**Urgency:** IMMEDIATE

### Issue #3: Officer Succession
**Problem:** No Vice President to assume duties if you're unavailable  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Chapter operations could halt  
**Resolution:** Recruit Vice President OR amend bylaws  
**Urgency:** MODERATE

### Issue #4: Audit/Financial Review
**Problem:** Treasurer required to arrange annual audit per Article V, Section
5  
**Impact:** LOW (current) - Required annually  
**Resolution:** Board Resolution 2025-01 (appoint self as Treasurer)  
**Urgency:** MODERATE (due by year-end)

---

## LEGAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Financial Instruments May Be Challenged**
   - Checks signed only by President could be questioned
   - Bank may refuse checks without proper dual signature
   - **Mitigation:** Board Resolution + Bank notification + Bylaw amendment

2. **Corporate Formalities Not Met**
   - IRS/State may question governance structure
   - 501(c)(3) status could theoretically be challenged
   - **Mitigation:** Document good-faith compliance efforts

3. **Member/Third-Party Challenges**
   - Disgruntled member could challenge Board actions
   - Vendors could question authority to contract
   - **Mitigation:** Transparency + membership approval of amendments

4. **Insurance Coverage**
   - Directors & Officers insurance may require proper structure
   - **Mitigation:** Review policy, notify insurer if required

**Overall:** Risk is manageable with proper documentation and member
communication.

## COMPLIANCE PATHWAY (3-STEP SOLUTION)

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: BOARD RESOLUTION 2025-01 (DONE)
**Purpose:** Immediate interim solution  
**Action:** Appoint yourself to all vacant officer positions  
**Legal Basis:** Article IV, Section 12, Paragraph 3  
**Status:** Document created, needs signature  
**Effect:** Allows operations to continue while maintaining documentation

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 2: BYLAW AMENDMENT (DONE - NEEDS VOTE)

**Action:** Amend Article V, Section 1 and Article VI, Section 2  
**Legal Basis:** Article XI, Section 2

**Effect:** Makes current structure legally compliant going forward

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: ONGOING RECRUITMENT (IN PROGRESS)
**Purpose:** Return to traditional governance when possible

**Legally:** DEFENSIBLE - If you follow the 3-step compliance pathway.

**Best Practice:** TEMPORARY - While recruiting to fill positions.

**Bottom Line:** You are currently NOT in full compliance, but you have a clear
legal pathway to achieve compliance through the documents already prepared. The
key is DOCUMENTATION and TRANSPARENCY.

Sign the Resolution, pass the Amendment, continue recruiting. You'll be legally
solid.
