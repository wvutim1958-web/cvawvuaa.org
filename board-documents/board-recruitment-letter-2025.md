# BOARD MEMBER RECRUITMENT LETTER
## Central Virginia Chapter of the WVU Alumni Association, Inc.

**Subject:** Help Shape the Future of Our WVU Alumni Chapter

Dear Fellow Mountaineer,

I hope this message finds you well and filled with pride in our West Virginia
University heritage. I am reaching out to you today with an important
opportunity to make a meaningful impact on our Central Virginia alumni
community.

## THE SITUATION

As you may know, our previous Board of Directors resigned effective June 30,
2025. While this was a difficult transition, I am honored to have stepped
forward as President to ensure our Chapter continues serving the WVU alumni
community in Central Virginia.

However, I cannot do this alone.

Despite our Chapter's success in hosting game watch parties, managing member
benefits, and supporting our scholarship fund, we currently have vacant
positions on our Board of Directors. Our bylaws call for a Vice President,
Secretary, and Treasurer, as well as optional positions like Communications
Director and Activities Coordinator.

## WHY WE NEED YOU

Our Chapter serves dozens of WVU alumni across the Richmond, Charlottesville,
and surrounding areas. We have:

- An active membership base paying annual dues
- Successful game watch events throughout football season
- A growing scholarship endowment
- A professional website and social media presence
- Strong relationships with local venues and businesses

But to continue this important work, we need dedicated volunteers willing to
serve on the Board.

## WHAT WE ARE ASKING

We are seeking alumni willing to serve as:

**VICE PRESIDENT**
- Assist the President with Chapter leadership
- Preside over meetings when President is unavailable
- Help coordinate major events and initiatives
- Estimated time: 3 to 5 hours per month

**SECRETARY**
- Maintain meeting minutes and Chapter records
- Handle official correspondence
- Ensure proper notice of meetings
- Estimated time: 2 to 4 hours per month

**TREASURER**
- Oversee Chapter finances and bank accounts
- Prepare financial reports
- Process membership dues and payments
- Estimated time: 3 to 5 hours per month

**OPTIONAL APPOINTED POSITIONS:**
- Communications Director (social media, newsletters)
- Activities Director (event planning and coordination)
- Membership Director (recruitment and retention)
- At Large Director (general support)

## WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN

While these are volunteer positions, serving on the Board offers:

- Leadership experience in nonprofit governance
- Networking with fellow WVU alumni and professionals
- Recognition as an official chapter leader
- Potential access to WVU Alumni Association conferences and training
- The satisfaction of giving back to your alma mater
- Reasonable expense reimbursement for Chapter related travel

## TIME COMMITMENT

We understand everyone is busy. Here is what we realistically need:

- **Quarterly Board Meetings:** 4 meetings per year (can be virtual)
- **Annual Business Meeting:** 1 meeting per year with full membership
- **Email Communication:** Periodic updates and decisions between meetings
- **Event Participation:** Optional attendance at game watches and social events

**Total estimated time: 4 to 8 hours per month, depending on position**

## NO FUNDRAISING PRESSURE

Let me be clear: We are NOT asking you to fundraise, solicit donations, or sell
anything. Our Chapter is funded through member dues and operates on a modest
budget. We simply need people willing to help with governance, planning, and
execution of our mission.

## CURRENT OPERATIONS

Even with limited Board members, we have successfully:

- Hosted multiple game watch parties this season
- Maintained our professional website (cvawvuaa.org)
- Managed member database and payment systems
- Featured outstanding alumni like Judge Roderick "Rod" Young '94
- Kept our nonprofit status and legal compliance current

Imagine what we could accomplish with a full Board!

## HOW TO VOLUNTEER

If you are interested in serving, or even just want to learn more, please:

1. **Reply to this email**, or
2. **Call/text me at:** (804) 566-8058, or
3. **Visit our website:** cvawvuaa.org/contact

I am happy to answer any questions, discuss specific roles, or simply talk about
what Board service entails. There is no pressure, just an honest conversation
about how you can help.

## EVEN IF YOU CANNOT SERVE

If Board service is not right for you at this time, you can still help by:

- **Suggesting others:** Know a WVU alum who might be interested? Forward this email!
- **Staying engaged:** Attend our events, renew your membership, spread the word
- **Providing input:** Share ideas for events, programs, or improvements

## THE BOTTOM LINE

Our Chapter is at a crossroads. We can either:

1. **Thrive** with a dedicated Board leading us forward, or
2. **Struggle** with minimal leadership and limited programming

I choose to thrive. I hope you will join me.

West Virginia University alumni are known for their loyalty, passion, and
community spirit. Let us show that same spirit here in Central Virginia. Whether
you graduated last year or decades ago, whether you live in Richmond or
Charlottesville, whether you can give 5 hours a month or 10, we have a place for
you.

## LET'S GO MOUNTAINEERS!

Thank you for considering this opportunity. Our Chapter has tremendous
potential, and with your help, we can achieve great things for WVU alumni in
Central Virginia.

Feel free to reach out anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

**Timothy Casten**
President
Central Virginia Chapter, WVU Alumni Association, Inc.
