## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

**PDFs won't upload to Mailchimp:**
- File size limit is 10MB - compress if needed
- Accepted formats: PDF only
- Alternative: Host on website, link instead of attach

**Video link not working:**
- ThankView links are specific - don't modify the URL
- Link expires after certain time - check with WVU if broken
- Some email clients block external links - test in multiple clients

**HTML email looks broken:**
- Make sure you copied ALL the HTML code
- Check that email client supports HTML
- Send plain text version as backup

**Low open rates:**
- Try different subject line
- Send at different time of day
- Make sure email isn't landing in spam
- Check that your sender address is trusted
