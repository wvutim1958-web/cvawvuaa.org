Dear Mountaineer,

Our new slogan says it all: Old Gold - New Fire.

Little by little, the Game Watches are growing. People are coming back. Game watches will move around the Richmond Area. And the Chapter will show we still have some Fire, and it's growing every week.

Moments like our recent game watch prove what being a Mountaineer is all about — showing up, sticking together, and keeping that old gold and blue spirit alive no matter what. The flame doesn't fade; it just needs fuel.
