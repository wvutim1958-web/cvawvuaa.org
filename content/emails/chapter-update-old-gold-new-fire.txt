ðŸ”¥ Old Gold - New Fire | Chapter Update

Dear {{NAME}},

Our new slogan says it all: OLD GOLD - NEW FIRE.

Little by little, the Game Watches are growing. People are coming back. Game watches will move around the Richmond Area. And the Chapter will show we still have some Fire, and it's growing every week.

REMEMBER: Your dues keep the scholarship fund alive. Every membership renewal directly supports deserving students and strengthens our chapter.
