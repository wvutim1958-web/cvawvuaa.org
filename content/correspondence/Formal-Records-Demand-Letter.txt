Subject: OFFICIAL DEMAND - Transfer of Chapter Records and Assets

[Treasurer's Name],

As the officially recognized President of the Central Virginia Chapter of WVU Alumni Association (confirmed by Past President Jennifer Condaras on August 7, 2025), I am formally demanding the immediate transfer of all chapter records, accounts, and assets currently in your possession.

LEGAL REQUIREMENT:
Per our Chapter Bylaws Article VII, Section 1, the Chapter is required to maintain:
• Original or copies of adequate and correct bookkeeping and records of accounts
• Records of assets, liabilities, receipts, disbursements, gains and losses
• All financial records and account access information

IMMEDIATE TRANSFER REQUIRED:
You are hereby directed to transfer within 48 hours:

FINANCIAL RECORDS:
• All bank account information and access credentials
• All financial statements and records for the past 3 years
• All receipts, invoices, and disbursement records
• All tax filing documents and correspondence
• All scholarship fund documentation

MEMBER RECORDS:
• Complete membership database and contact information
• All dues payment records and histories
• All correspondence with members regarding payments

CHAPTER ASSETS:
• All chapter property, equipment, or materials in your possession
• All vendor contacts and account information
• All insurance documentation
• Any chapter funds, checkbooks, or financial instruments

LEGAL AUTHORITY:
• Jennifer Condaras officially confirmed my presidency on August 7, 2025
• Article VII, Section 3 of our Bylaws grants absolute inspection rights
• As President, I have fiduciary responsibility for chapter assets
• Withholding chapter records violates your fiduciary duties as outgoing officer

CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:
Failure to transfer these records within 48 hours will result in:
• Formal complaint to WVU Alumni Association
• Potential legal action for breach of fiduciary duty
• Report to Virginia State Corporation Commission
• Potential involvement of legal counsel

This is not optional. These are chapter assets and records that legally belong to the organization, not to individual officers.

CONTACT FOR TRANSFER:
Please contact me immediately at [your phone] or [your email] to arrange transfer of all materials.

I expect your full cooperation in this matter.

Timothy Casten
President, CVCWVUAA
