Freshwater fishing, with a strong interest in river and lake fishing. I enjoy working with different techniques including trolling, casting, and live bait.

I prefer freshwater bass, catfish, and panfish, but I also enjoy exploring new waters and adapting to different fishing styles.

Years of experience fishing rivers and lakes in West Virginia and Virginia. I’ve hosted and coordinated recreational outings for family and community members, often tying fishing into broader activities like boating, outdoor education, and special needs outreach.
Grew up with the professional fisherman Curtis Fleming and know him well, know one of his friends well also that runs a cabin and fishing tours on the South Branch of the Potomac just south of Petersburg WV. Would be a great place for a Group Outing Tim is very knowledgeable and you will catch your compliment of Small Mouth and Trout. Curtis has a video on youtube going out with Tim and catching over 100 Smallies in a few hours. Great Place and resonably priced and very nice cabins. 

To share experiences with fellow anglers, learn new techniques, and contribute to the club’s community-oriented mission. I’d like to be involved in both fishing events and volunteer opportunities, especially those that help promote the outdoors for families and young people.
